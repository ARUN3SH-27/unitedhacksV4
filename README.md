# LiteGame - Game Hub

LiteGame is a Python-based game hub that combines several classic games in one place, built using the Tkinter library for a simple and engaging user experience. The goal is to offer a lightweight, accessible platform for users to enjoy classic games without the need for installation or heavy software.

## About the Project

### Inspiration
LiteGame was inspired by the idea of creating a platform that brings together multiple classic games in a simple interface. Itâ€™s designed for casual gaming with no need for downloading or installing complex software. The goal is to create a fun, engaging experience for users of all ages.

### How I Built the Project
LiteGame was developed using Python and Tkinter. The project is structured around:
- **Main Game Hub:** An entry point where users can select from several games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, Rock Paper Scissors, and Number Guessing.
- **Individual Game Logic:** Each game is built with its own mechanics (e.g., tracking moves, guesses, and win conditions).
- **Interactive Interface:** Tkinter was used to create an intuitive GUI where users can easily interact with each game.

## Games Included
1. **Tic-Tac-Toe:** A classic two-player game where users take turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid.
2. **Hangman:** A word-guessing game where users guess letters to uncover a hidden word.
3. **Rock Paper Scissors:** A simple two-player game where users select rock, paper, or scissors to play against the computer.
4. **Number Guessing:** A game where the computer selects a random number, and the user has to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LiteGame.git
   ```

2. Install Python (version 3.x or higher) if not already installed.

3. Install Tkinter if you don't have it:
   bash
   pip install tk
   ```

4. Run the game hub:
   bash
   python litegame.py
   ```

## What I Learned
- **Tkinter GUI Development:** Building an interactive GUI with buttons, labels, and event handling using Tkinter.
- **Game Logic Implementation:** Implementing basic game mechanics like turn-based actions, input validation, and win conditions.
- **User Experience Design:** Focusing on simplicity and usability to create an engaging user experience for all ages.

## Challenges I Faced
- **Managing Multiple Games:** Ensuring smooth transitions between games and keeping each gameâ€™s state separate was challenging.
- **State Management:** Resetting game states and handling user input validation properly required careful design to avoid errors.
- **Smooth User Input Handling:** Ensuring that user input was properly validated and error-free across all games.

## Future Plans
- Expand LiteGame by adding more games (e.g., Chess, Sudoku).
- Enhance the logic of existing games with features like score tracking and game history.
- Add multiplayer functionality or AI opponents for games like Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Consider developing a mobile version for wider accessibility.
